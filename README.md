# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game** – a fun little terminal-based Python project where you try to guess the number the computer is thinking of!

## 🧠 About the Game

- The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
- You choose a difficulty level:  
  - **Easy** → 10 attempts  
  - **Hard** → 5 attempts  
- Based on your guesses, you'll get hints if you're too high or too low.
- Game continues until you guess it right or run out of attempts.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
- Basic control flow & loops

## 🎓 Challenge Info

This was **one of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code challenges**.

> 🔥 I completed this challenge entirely on my own — without watching her tutorial, without using the hints.  
> I just played the game she built, and then reverse-engineered and recreated it from scratch. 💪
